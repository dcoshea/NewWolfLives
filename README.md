============

A fork resurrecting NewWolf (Wolfenstein 3D for OpenGL on Windows)

NewWolf was last updated in 2006 (version 0.73).  As I have not heard back from the author and have some fixes and ideas for improvements, I'm creating this fork for those who want a more modern (although perhaps less "authentic") Wolfenstein 3D experience.  With the code on GitHub, it will be easy for anyone else to fork in case I also disappear!
